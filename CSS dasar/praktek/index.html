            <h3>The Vibes Of Soul</h3>
            <p>Faith is something that originates deep within the heart, where beliefs take root and flourish.
                 It is expressed through words that resonate with conviction, allowing individuals to articulate 
                 their beliefs and share their insights with others. Furthermore, faith is not merely an abstract 
                 concept; it is brought to life through actions and deeds, demonstrating commitment and authenticity 
                 in everyday life. Together, these three pillars believing in the heart, speaking verbally, and 
                 practicing through deeds form a comprehensive understanding of what it truly means to have faith.</p>

        <li>
            <h2>Faith in Allah</h2>
            <p>Believing that there is no God worthy of worship except Allah SWT and believing that Allah created the 
                universe and all creatures in the heavens and the earth and everything in them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Faith in Angels</h2>
            <p>Faith in angels means believing in their existence. The existence of angels is explained in the QS. 
            As-Sajdah verse 11 which means, "Say: The angel of death who was entrusted to (take your life) will kill you, then only to your Lord will you be returned."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Belief in the books of Allah</h2>
            <p>Allah sent down revelations to the Prophets and Apostles containing guidance. The collection of instructions 
            is called a book. The book contains commands, prohibitions, good and bad promises, as well as advice and instructions on how to live and worship.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Faith in the Prophet and His Messenger</h2>
            <p>Faith in the Prophets and Apostles means believing that Allah sent the Prophets and Apostles to convey 
                the message of monotheism to mankind. The difference between a Prophet and an Apostle is that a Prophet is not necessarily an Apostle, while an Apostle is definitely a Prophet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Belief in the Day of Judgment</h2>
            <p>The next pillar of faith is faith in the Day of Judgment. This means that Muslims must believe that there
                will be a time when the universe will be destroyed and replaced with an eternal afterlife.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Faith in Qadha and Qadar</h2>
            <p>Belief in Qadha and Qadar means believing that everything happens with Allah's permission. Therefore, 
            everything that happens must be accepted with an open heart by all creatures because good and bad fate has been determined and determined by Allah SWT.</p>

            <p>From Anas bin Malik (90 H) from the Prophet SAW, he said, "Three things that if someone has them, he will get the sweetness of faith:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Making him Allah and His Messenger more beloved than other than the two of them.</li>
                <li>If he loves someone, he does not love him except for the sake of Allah, and</li>
                <li>he hates returning to disbelief as much as he hates being thrown into hell"</li>
            </ul>
